Reminder my first time on Github so i may need help along the way if this gets big!!! :0

This app will be a free project of mine which il be learning along the way of developing it :) dont expect amazing features its just the limit of my knowledge 
and i just want to create a project that will keep me wanting to do more with software development 

About Me.
im 19 right know study IT in colledge been doing software development since 16 doing all sorts of projects and little programs and i have learnt alot from doing so 
all the ideas and features will be coming straight from my knowledge of past projects i also have a great friend that usually does the UI design of my projects 
as i get to carried away with the coding part i forget about the looks and user ability of the program but thanks to him im able to produce great quality programs 
that funciton at 100% of the time ;).




About the Program:
Basically this program will notify you about subscriptions e.g., Spotify, Amazon Prime stuff like that its endless. Right now the program will be on 
window based systems in the future Apple Android Linux but that will have to wait as i never made anything on those platforms, This Software will be Open to all
users and they can take my code make it better i dont mind. but please if you do take bits please give a thanks atleast :), and when the program comes to other devices 
il try to keep it free but Apple may make it difficult if so il think of a funcky way of getting past it also the app wont be filled with Ads. i want it free and clean 
and want no profit from it as im a nice guy.


il start if this post gets attention from people searching for summit like this if so say in the Issues area saying if your intreasted or not 




Thanks all.
